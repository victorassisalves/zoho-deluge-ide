I have implemented the following:
1. Workspace management: Added Project Name input and structured storage to isolate data (code, files, notes, mappings) by project URL and Name.
2. AI Model Update: Updated the default AI model to Gemini 2.0/3.0 and added them to the settings selector.
3. Version Bump: Updated extension version to 1.2.3 across all relevant files.
4. Shortcuts Fix: Replaced key-code based listeners with e.code listeners to ensure shortcuts work reliably in incognito and across environments.
5. UI Improvements:
   - Restored sidebars in side-panel mode.
   - Added a "Run" (Save & Execute) button.
   - Added a "Snippets" sidebar with 20+ Deluge snippets and click-to-insert logic.
6. Stability: Fixed a critical syntax error in snippets logic and wrapped ide.js in an IIFE to prevent namespace collisions. Fixed CSP issues by moving inline scripts to a loader.
7. Connectivity: Improved Zoho region detection (added .ca, .uk, etc.) and connection feedback.
